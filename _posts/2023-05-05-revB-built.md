The new laser bed is assembled and built into my laser cutter.

I thought I would be able to put the laser bed together inside my K40 clone,
but I ended up taking the lasser cutter apart to insert the fully assembled 
table. The manual crank works pretty well and I can reach everything I need
in the tight space to readjust the belt, if necessary.
