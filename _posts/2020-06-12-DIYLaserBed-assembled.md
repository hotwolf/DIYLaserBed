The DIYLaserBed has been assembled and it works.
I've redesigned the crank wheel to make it fit into trhe laser cutter.
This is my initial and my final design (my first multi color print).

My timing belt turned oit to be a little longer than what I had ordered, but there is still plenty of room to tighten it.

Now the whole thing needs to be reassembled inside my laser cutter.
